# Resource Groups

* Tags are key-value pairs attached to resources
* Tags can be inherited \(created by one service, moves to another service\)
* **Resource groups:** Make it easy to group resources based on tags assigned to them
* Resource groups contain info like:
  * Region
  * Name
  * Healthchecks
  * EC2 - Public/Private IP Addresses
  * ELB - Port Configs
  * RDS - Database Engine
* You can search for resources by a specific tag \(used by a particular department, user ID, etc\)
* Tag Editor allows you to find resources not tagged and add tags
