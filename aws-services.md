# AWS Services

**Amazon Simple Workflow Service \(SWF\)**: This a web service that makes it easy to coordinate work across distributed application components. Amazon SWF enables applications for a range of use cases, including media processing, web application back-ends, business process workflows, and analytics pipelines, to be designed as a coordination of tasks.

**AWS Application Discovery Service:** This helps systems integrators quickly and reliably plan application migration projects by automatically identifying applications running in on-premises data centres, their associated dependencies, and their performance profiles.

**AWS Migration Hub:** This provides a single location to track the progress of application migrations across multiple AWS and partner solutions.

**AWS Snowball Migration Service:** Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure devices to transfer large amounts of data into and out of the AWS Cloud.

**AWS Database Migration Service \(DMS\):** This is used to migrate your data to and from most widely used commercial and open-source databases. AWS DMS supports homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon Aurora.

**AWS Directory Service:** This is a managed Microsoft Active Directory in the AWS Cloud. Customers can use it to manage users and groups, provide single sign-on \(SSO\) to applications and services, as well as create and apply group policies.

* Note: What is Single sign-on \(SSO\)? Single sign-on \(SSO\) enables a companyâ€™s employees to sign in to AWS using their existing corporate Microsoft Active Directory credentials.

**Amazon Route 53:** Is used for registering domain names, routing end users to Internet applications, configuring DNS health checks to route traffic to healthy endpoints, managing traffic globally through a variety of routing types etc.

**AWS Data Pipeline:** This is a web service that helps you reliably process and move data between different AWS compute and storage services, as well as on-premises data sources. AWS Data Pipeline integrates with on-premise and cloud-based storage systems to allow developers to use their data when they need it, where they want it, and in the required format.

**AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\):** You can use ACM or IAM to store and deploy server certificates. Use IAM as a certificate manager only when you must support HTTPS connections in a region that is not supported by ACM. IAM supports deploying server certificates in all regions, but you must obtain your certificate from an external provider for use with AWS.

**AWS CodeDeploy:** This is a fully managed deployment service that automates software deployments to a variety of compute services such as Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, and your on-premises servers.

**AWS Elastic Beanstalk:** This makes it easier for developers to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud. Developers simply upload their application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring.

**Amazon Macie:** This is a security service that uses machine learning to automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS. Amazon Macie recognizes sensitive data such as personally identifiable information \(PII\) or intellectual property, and provides you with dashboards and alerts that give visibility into how this data is being accessed or moved.

 **AWS OpsWorks:** Is a configuration management service that provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet. Chef and Puppet are automation platforms that allow you to use code to automate the configurations of your servers. OpsWorks lets you use Chef and Puppet to automate how servers are configured, deployed, and managed across your Amazon EC2 instances or on-premises compute environments.

**AWS Marketplace:** A digital catalog with thousands of software listings from independent software vendors that make it easy to find, test, buy, and deploy software that runs on AWS. AWS Marketplace includes software listings from categories such as security, networking, storage, machine learning, business intelligence, database, and DevOps.
