# Cloud Concepts

## What is Cloud Computing?

* On-demand delivery of compute, database storage, applications, other IT resources through cloud platform via Internet
* Pay-as-you-go pricing

## 6 Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. Trade capital expense for variable expense

    ○ Only pay for what you use

2. Benefit from massive economies of scale

    ○ You won't have same purchasing power as Amazon

    ○ They get cheaper prices to purchase servers, hardware

3. Stop guessing about capacity

    ○ You'll buy too much or too little. Too much = wasted money, too little

4. Increase speed and agility

    ○ Websites/apps can scale infinitely with demand

5. Stop spending money running/maintaining data centers

    ○ Focus on what you're good at, not managing infrastructures

6. Go global in minutes

    ○ Deploy apps in minutes

    ○ Provide lower latency and better experience at minimal cost

## 3 Types of Cloud Computing

1. Infrastructure as a Service \(IAAS\)

    ○ You manage the server \(physical or virtual\) as well as the operating system

    ○ Data centre provider has no access to your server

2. Platform as a Service \(PAAS\)

    ○ Someone else manages the underlying hardware and operating systems, you just focus on your applications

    ○ You upload your code and it just executes

    ○ Think of GoDaddy

3. Software as a Service \(SAAS\)

    ○ Think of Gmail or Office 365

    ○ All you do is interact with the application, manage the software and how you want to use it

    ○ Someone else takes care of the infrastructure and everything related to it

## 3 Types of Cloud Computing Deployments

1. Public Cloud - AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform
2. Hybrid - Mix of public and private

    ○ May want to keep some sensitive data on-premise

3. Private Cloud \(or on-premise\) - You manage it in your data centre, Openstack or Vmware
