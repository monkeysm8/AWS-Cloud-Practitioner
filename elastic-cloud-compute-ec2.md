# Elastic Cloud Compute \(EC2\)

* EC2 is compute-based, it's not serverless. It is a server! 
* Use private key to connect to EC2 
* Security groups are virtual firewalls in the cloud. Need to open ports in order to use them \(22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, 3389 for RDP\) 
* Always design for failure, have one EC2 instance in each availability zone \(AZ\)
